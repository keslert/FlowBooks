          <span>Alice in Wonderland</span>
        </h1>

        <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
          bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
          book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
          it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
          conversation?'
          <br /><br />So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure
          of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
          picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
          close by her.
          <br /><br />In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
          in the world she was to get out again.

            The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
          dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
          about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
          well.
          <br /><br />
            Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.

          'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
          <br /><br />There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
        </p>

        <div class="cat-shape2"></div>
        <p>
          'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?'
          'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
        </p>

        <div class="cat-shape3"></div>
        <p>
          'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.'
          'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
        </p>

        <div class="cat-shape4"></div>
        <p>
          'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
          <br /><br />
          'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
          <br /><br />
          Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
        </p>

            The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
            'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="act act2">

            <p>
              'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
              'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
              'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'
             </p>
             <p>
               'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?'
               'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited yet.'
             </p>
             <p>
               'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
             </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="act act3">
          <div class="alice-shape"></div>
          <div class="content-wrapper">
            <div class="cat-paws-shape"></div>
            <p>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="act act4">

            <p>
              She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself <br /><br />'Suppose it should be raving mad after all!

            <p>
              She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat!'
            </p>
            <p>
              'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
